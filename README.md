Unity Multi-level Adventure Game

This is a puzzle-adventure game that my partner and I made for our game programming class. It was developed on Unity using many C#. We had loads of fun designing and making it! There were many details and functionalities we added, which we are ecstatic about. Right now, there are 3 levels. The storyline is that you're on a quest to save your dad but you need to pass the levels going up the castle. 
It became too big to fit on Github...but you can check it out here: https://youtu.be/8Eq3G98A9TQ
